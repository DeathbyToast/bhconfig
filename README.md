# About this config

These files were designed for SlashDiablo but can be used elsewhere since Slash is vanilla D2 with very few changes. 
These are close to M81's (Slashdiablo default) BH maphack config tier system with quite a bit of changes to add QoL for low levels + some endgame things. Lots of changes are all logged in the link below. The settings file also utilizes the beta features added by DannyIsGreat like showing all items on the ground without holding a button and tracking your runs for you.
This version makes it super easy to add items for your holy grail needs as well. BH-classic is a config specifically for in classic D2 mode.

# Adding Holy Grail items to config
* This config already includes many of the holy grail items you're looking for, but if something is missing that you specifically want to add, you can do so like this:
* Make sure to turn ON maphack override option in SlashDiablo Launcher before editing your BH.cfg file.
* Close D2. Simply Copy the lines you want from [here](https://github.com/BeLikeLeBron/bhconfig/blob/master/Holy_Grail_All_Uniques_and_Sets.txt), then in your BH.cfg file in your slashdiablo/d2 folder under the section labled "ADD HOLY GRAIL ITEMS HERE" paste them and save. 
* If you dont see that line, you can add these items under the "UNIQUES AND SETS" part of your BH.cfg config and it should work perfectly.
* BE WARNED: your ping level must match the lines TIER number to notify you of the drop
* NOTE: in the link above for grail items, all uniques are Tier 4 items, All sets are Tier 5 items. Feel free to change them as you wish.
* %TIER-X% REQUIRES BH 1.9.9 to work. If you dont want to use on 1.9.9, simply remove %TIER-x% from all the lines.



# Config basics
* Items are grouped into tiers based on relative worth. Worth is loosely defined as some combination of usefulness and rarity.
* Consistent colors are used to indicate the item tiers. The map box and item name indicator (leading 0) colors always match.
  - Tier1 (Orange): The good stuff. Sur, ber, jah, griff's, etc.
  - Tier2 (Purple): Vexes, ohms, arachs, high end socketables, etc.
  - Tier3 (Red): Tal armor, shako, etc.
  - Tier4 (Gold): Occy, titan's, vmagi, etc.
  - Tier5 (Green): Magefist, TO gloves, Tal belt, etc.
* Many useful shoppables are highlighted, including ladder reset stuff.
* Tries to ping every usable unique and set item. Useless ones are not hidden but will not ping.
* Tries to ping every useful socketable, including plague bases.
* Useful charged items are highlighted: life tap wands, lower resist wands, teleport staves
* The item filter works on an item by item basis. Only the junkiest stuff is hidden. Nothing is hidden with clvl<40. There is little risk that useful things are blocked by this filter.
* Does not attempt to judge the value of identified rare/crafted/magic items. Does ping unidentified rare/magic items worth IDing.
* Shows affix level on magic, rare, and crafted items when it is different from ilvl. The format is ilvl/alvl.
